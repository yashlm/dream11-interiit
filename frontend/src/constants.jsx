    "This team prioritizes a strong bowling attack, complemented by explosive all-rounders capable of quick runs and crucial wickets.  The bowling selection focuses on recent economy rates and career bowling ratings, aiming for consistent control and wicket-taking ability. The all-rounders provide a balance, offering both batting firepower and additional bowling support.  While some bowlers have lower wicket totals, their recent performance suggests they can contribute significantly. The team lacks a dedicated top-order batsman, but the all-rounders' abilities mitigate this risk.",

    "6c3aef71":
      "Timothy Grant Southee is a seasoned bowler with a decent career bowling rating (CBR) of 2.87. While his recent economy rate is slightly high (7.13), his long-term average wickets per match (1.40) suggests consistency. His lower recent wicket count warrants monitoring, but his experience makes him a valuable asset.",
    "72c9ad99":
      "Thomas Ackland Blundell is an all-rounder whose recent performance is moderate, with an average fantasy score of 42.73 over the last 15 matches. His highest score of 68 indicates potential for big innings, but his consistency needs improvement. His role as an all-rounder adds value to the team.",
    d8f59089:
      "Mohammed Siraj is a bowler with a good CBR (3.03) but a relatively low number of career wickets (1). His recent economy rate (6.11) is acceptable, but his bowling average (36.78) suggests room for improvement in efficiency.",
    "33946d69":
      "Jasprit Jasbirsingh Bumrah boasts an impressive recent economy rate of 4.49 and a good bowling average of 24.37. Despite a relatively low number of career wickets (2), his recent performance suggests strong potential. He is a key asset to the team's bowling strategy.",
    "495d42a5":
      "Ravichandran Ashwin, with a CBR of 2.74, shows decent overall performance.  However, his recent bowling average (45.35) and economy rate (5.06) are comparatively higher than other bowlers, indicating a need for improved consistency in his recent form.",
    "6c19c6e5":
      "Insufficient data is available for this player to provide a meaningful performance analysis.  Further information is needed to assess their contribution to the team.",
    "740742ef":
      "Rohit Gurunath Sharma is a high-impact all-rounder with an exceptional average fantasy score of 66.87 over the last 15 matches. His 30 centuries showcase his batting prowess, and his high strike rate of 119.76 in the last three matches highlights his explosive batting style. He's a crucial asset to the team.",
    "8afe73e2":
      "William Alexander Young is a solid all-rounder with a recent average fantasy score of 58.4.  His 3 centuries and a recent strike rate of 87.31 indicate a consistent batting performance.  His all-around capabilities make him a valuable addition.",
    "8d2c70ad":
      "Kuldeep Yadav has a decent CBR of 2.45 and a respectable recent economy rate of 4.21.  His low career wicket count (1) needs to be addressed, but his recent bowling average of 30.22 suggests potential for improvement.",
    "919a3be2":
      "Rishabh Rajendra Pant is an all-rounder with a recent average fantasy score of 57.4.  He has scored one century and maintains a decent recent strike rate of 95.18.  His potential for big innings makes him a valuable asset.",
    "9a46c4e5":
      "Glenn Dominic Phillips is a bowler with zero career wickets, indicating a need for significant improvement in this area.  His recent economy rate of 5.64 and bowling average of 58.46 are high, suggesting he needs considerable improvement before being a reliable contributor.",
