**Product UI for Dream11 Inter-IIT Mid-Prep PS**
<br>
<br>
This repository is structured to streamline data processing, modeling, and UI integration. Below is an overview of each folder and its purpose.


**ðŸš€ Main Application**

**main_app.py:** The main entry point for running the project. This script leverages various modules from the src directory to function.

````
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   <- Project overview and usage instructions



â”œâ”€â”€ data                        <- Data folder with all stages of data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interim                 <- Intermediate data files generated during processing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ processed               <- Finalized datasets ready for modeling
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ raw                     <- Original data as downloaded
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ cricksheet_data     <- Raw data from Cricksheet
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ additional_data     <- Raw data from other sources, if any




â”œâ”€â”€ data_processing             <- Scripts to process data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_download.py        <- Download all project data using this script. All raw data sources are processed here before further use.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature_engineering.py  <- Handles all data manipulation and feature engineering for the project.



â”œâ”€â”€ docs                        <- Documentation and project demo
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ video_demo              <- Walk-through video, covering setup, UI, and functionality




â”œâ”€â”€ model                       <- Modeling scripts for training and prediction
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train_model.py          <- Model training script
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ predict_model.py        <- Prediction script with trained models



â”œâ”€â”€ model_artifacts             <- Storage for trained models
â”‚                             (Includes pre-trained model for Product UI and models from Model UI)



â”œâ”€â”€ out_of_sample_data          <- Sample dummy data for evaluation matches, After submission is done we will put testing data here (4th - 14th Dec)
                                in the same format as the sample data provided. This folder should be well integrated with Model UI where it will
                                automatically append the new data with already avalaible data from cricksheet.


â”œâ”€â”€ rest                        <- For any miscellaneous requirements not covered by other folders 

â””â”€â”€ UI                          <- All files related to the user interface
